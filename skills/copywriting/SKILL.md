# Copywriting

> Professional copywriting for headlines, CTAs, landing pages, and persuasive content.

## Trigger

- User needs marketing copy, headlines, or taglines
- User is creating landing page content
- User needs email subject lines or body copy
- User wants to improve conversion rates

## Core Framework: AIDA

**A**ttention → **I**nterest → **D**esire → **A**ction

## Instructions

### 1. Headlines (Attention)

**Formula Options:**

| Type | Formula | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| How-to | "How to [achieve X] without [pain Y]" | "How to lose weight without giving up pizza" |
| Number | "[Number] ways to [achieve result]" | "7 ways to double your productivity" |
| Question | "Do you [common problem]?" | "Do you struggle to wake up early?" |
| Direct | "[Do X]. [Get Y]." | "Build faster. Ship sooner." |

**Rules:**
- Keep under 10 words
- Lead with the benefit
- Be specific (numbers, timeframes)
- Avoid jargon

### 2. Subheadlines (Interest)

Expand on the headline with:
- Who it's for
- What makes it different
- Social proof snippet

**Template:**
> "[Product] helps [audience] [achieve result] by [unique mechanism]. Join [number] users who already [benefit]."

**Example:**
> "Notion helps teams organize their work in one place. Join 30M+ users who've ditched scattered docs."

### 3. Value Proposition (Desire)

Use the **Before/After/Bridge** framework:

1. **Before**: Describe current pain state
2. **After**: Paint the ideal outcome
3. **Bridge**: Show how your product gets them there

**Example:**
- Before: "Spending hours on manual data entry?"
- After: "Imagine having all your data synced automatically."
- Bridge: "Our AI automation handles it in seconds."

### 4. CTAs (Action)

**High-converting CTA formulas:**

| Type | Example | When to use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Benefit-focused | "Start saving time" | SaaS products |
| Risk-free | "Try free for 14 days" | Paid products |
| Urgency | "Get 50% off today" | Sales/promos |
| Curiosity | "See how it works" | Complex products |

**Rules:**
- Start with action verb
- Be specific about what happens next
- Reduce anxiety (free, no credit card, cancel anytime)

### 5. Feature → Benefit Conversion

Always convert features to benefits:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| "256-bit encryption" | "Your data is bank-level secure" |
| "AI-powered" | "Save 10 hours per week" |
| "Real-time sync" | "Your team is always on the same page" |

**Formula:**
> "[Feature] so you can [benefit] which means [emotional outcome]"

### 6. Social Proof

Types (in order of effectiveness):
1. **Specific numbers**: "Used by 50,000+ teams"
2. **Logos**: Known company logos
3. **Testimonials**: With name, photo, title
4. **Case studies**: "Company X increased revenue by 40%"

## Templates
